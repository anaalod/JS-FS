    <h3>Biography:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - Born in Turin on November 23rd.</li>
      <li><strong>1982</strong> - His talents won him a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival, where he first came into contact with the American minimalism.</li>
      <li><strong>1984-1991</strong> - Composer of the ballets "Sul filo d’Orfeo" (1984), "Time out" (1988), "The Wild Man" (1991).</li>
      <li><strong>1992</strong> - With the album "Stanze", a collection of sixteen compositions for harpist Cecilia Chailly, he set off on 'a journey towards essentiality, trying to achieve the maximum expressive intensity using the minimum indispensable'.</li>
      <li><strong>1996</strong> - But it was with "Le Onde", his first solo album, inspired by Virginia Woolf’s novel, that he captured the piano world’s attention</li>
      <li><strong>1999-2001</strong> - "Eden Roc", in which he played with a string quintet and duduk master Djavan Gasparyan, and "I giorni", a cycle of ballads for piano inspired by a trip into Mali. He returned to Africa two years later at the Festival au Desert.</li>
      <li><strong>2002</strong> - The score he wrote for the remake of "Doctor Zhivago" triumphed at the New York Film Festival. The increasing prestige of his soundtracks would be confirmed by "Not of This World" (2000), "Light of My Eyes" (2001), "Strange Crime" (2004), "This is England", film (2004) and TV series (2010), "The Untouchables" (2011), "Samba" (2014), "The Water Diviner" (2015) and "The Third Murder" (2017).</li>
      <li><strong>2004</strong> - The more concentrated, introspective and meditative was the studio album "Una mattina", the more expanded, challenging, sumptuous was the following Divenire with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. Both records, which were already topping the classical charts, crashed into the pop charts too for the first time. He was the only classical musician to play at the first iTunes festival. During the extended world tour that followed, he never stopped writing new music.</li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> - He released "Cloudland", with Robert and Ronald Lippok, and "Nightbook", a nocturnal, interior work that 'projects the piano in every direction, like a shadow'. The peak performance of his European and American tour was once again at the Royal Albert Hall, recorded live and released as a double CD and DVD. For two consecutive summers he conducted the Orchestra della Notte della Taranta, producing a visionary musical direction. </li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - He released "In a time lapse", a reflection on time, recorded in a monastery and 'conceived as a suite or as the chapters of a single novel', in which his piano was accompanied by strings, percussion and electronic tracks. The world tour that followed scored many remarkable performances, such as the Sidney Opera House, the Arena of Verona and the acclaimed "Piano Africain", for six pianos and six balafons and marimbas, which opened the Piano City Milano festival in 2014.</li>
      <li><strong>2015</strong> - The album "Elements" sprang ‘from the desire to start anew, following different paths to knowledge’. Recorded over a span of three months in his home studio in the Langhe countryside, ‘while spring was exploding’, the album became ‘a map of thoughts and feelings, points, lines, shapes and fragments of an ongoing interior flow through myth, Euclid, the periodic table and Kandinsky’s writings’. During the next three years, the "Elements" tour sold out the world’s top pop arenas and the greatest classical theatres.</li>
      <li><strong>2016</strong> - He performed his "Elegy for the Arctic", commissioned by Greenpeace, on a floating platform amidst the ice in the Arctic Ocean.</li>
      <li><strong>2019</strong> - "Seven Days Walking" is the title of the latest new recording project. 
        ‘I remember that in January 2018 I often went for long walks in the mountains, always following more or less the same trail. It snowed heavily, and my thoughts roamed free inside the storm, where all shapes, stripped bare by the cold, lost their contours and colours. Perhaps that feeling of extreme essence was the origin of this album’. 
        Seven Days is divided into seven episodes, seven albums (Day One, Day Two, etc. until Day Seven), released at monthly intervals. Each episode is focused on several main themes, which are recurring in different forms: seven variations following the same imaginary itinerary. </li>

      <p>"In his mingling of ambient, minimalist and cinematic strains, and his ear for a poignant melody, Ludovico Einaudi is the Italian equivalent of Michael Nyman, straddling classical, jazz, soundtrack and chillout... which develops a compelling momentum."</p>
